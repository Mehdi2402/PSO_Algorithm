# Study of the particule swarm optimization algorithm

## Abstract

This work aims to introduce the Particle swarm optimization(PSO) method,applied on a wide range of real life complex problems.Depending on the context, PSO outperforms other optimization methods suchas gradient based algorithms and other derivative-free algorithms, especially inthe case of some non-linear objective function, as they tend to get trapped inlocal optimums and fail to find the global one.The core of this paper is to discuss theories behind PSO, and then test them.We will apply PSO algorithm on highly complex non-linear functions and testthem  using  different  approaches  on  each  one  of  the  algorithm’s  parameters,aiming to build an improved version of PSO suitable for each problem.The empirical approach developed here,  brings some good insights on theseveral  shortcomings  of  PSO  that  we  need  to  overcome  like  premature  con-vergence  and  low  accuracy.   The  characteristics  of  a  function  will  have  someimplications  on  the  parameter’s  settings.   Finally,  we  demonstrate  the  powerof  PSO  with  the  right  parameters  in  optimizing  difficult  functions,  reducingcomputational cost and the risk of returning local optimum.
